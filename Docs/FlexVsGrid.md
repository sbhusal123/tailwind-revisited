# CSS FlexBox Vs CSS Grid

## 1. Flexbox

- Used to build one dimensional layout.

- Facilates laying out of items in either row in column.

- Cannot intentionally overlap elements in a layout.

- Content based and listens to the contents and adjusts to it.

- Used for scaling, one sided aligning, and organizing elements within a container.


## 2. Grid

- Used to build two dimensional layout.

- Facilates laying out items accross and down at once.

- Helps us create layouts with overlaping elements.

- Operates more on layout level and is container based.
